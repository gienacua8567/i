If you think fitness training is all about running, jumping, and lifting weights, then pause for a moment and read on.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Fitness training is not like a “one-size fit all” thing. Yes, it entails hard work to achieve serious fitness goals, nevertheless, fitness is fitness. You don’t need to have explosive biceps to be counted as being fit nor your abs should always be pronounced with that “six-pack” look. Some people do fitness training just to achieve a lean physique. And that’s not such a bad fitness goal. We all need to stay fit and maintain a considerable degree of fitness to be healthy. So fitness training should not be discriminating but rather inclusive.  And that’s exactly what it is. </strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>There are lots of ways you can do to achieve your fitness goals. It’s not just about pumping iron and always putting your body into physical stress. Yes, intensity, dedication, hard work, and even pushing your body to its limit could be one way of helping you achieve your fitness goal in less time but some of us are not quite tolerant of such physical stress. So, what’s another way to deal with it?
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Low-impact training or cross-training. Before we go any further, please take note that cross-training is pretty much different than CrossFit training. The latter is a branding of high-intensity workout routines while cross-training is a way or a technique to help you achieve your fitness goals with the use of low-impact exercises. Cross-training is a technique used in instances where an individual is recovering from an injury or has certain physical limitations probably due to disability or age. Nevertheless, cross-training is not limited to this scenario. It could be used as a regular fitness routine by able-bodied people. Some athletes go through cross-training to maintain their body conditioning while taking some rest from rigid training.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>In cross-training, you are replacing or doing alternative exercises that lessen the impact on your body, especially your joints. High impact workout routines sometimes pose a higher risk of joint injury due to its intensity. The idea is that “Cross-training works on the basis that one type of exercise can enhance an athlete’s performance in another.“  E.g., swimming is seen to improve a runner’s performance even though it uses a different set of muscle groups.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>One benefit that you can get out of cross-training is its flexibility in the various exercises that you can use as alternates. Some even suggest outdoor activities that are just as rigorous as trekking or biking. Which brings me to mention another benefit -- fun. Isn’t it more fun to go swimming or biking than staying in the gym all the time? 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Anyway, in case you just might not have the time or the opportunity to go outdoors -- and have fun, there are still a lot of gym exercises you can do that would allow for a low-impact workout. If you are a serious fitness buff and follows a rigorous fitness workout routine, you might want to try some cross-training exercises. It will definitely help you to get the boredom off of your routine and regain afresh new interest in your workout routine. Or if maybe you got some sore after a hard workout a cross-train might be the thing for you for the meantime instead of stopping dead and let those hardened muscles soften up again.
